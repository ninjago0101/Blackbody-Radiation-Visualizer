# Blackbody-Radiation-Visualizer
This project is a Python tool that helps visualize blackbody radiation using Planck’s law.  explore the peak wavelength and the total power emitted 


Features

Asks  for the number of temperatures and their values in Kelvin.
Automatically computes trends like Wien’s peak wavelength and total emitted power for each temperature.
Each curve is labeled 

How to run:

1. Requirements:
Install Python 3.x.
Install Matplotlib by running:
"pip install matplotlib"
2. Running  
save .py file and run via python 

3.Promtps
Enter the number of temperatures you want to plot.
Input each temperature in Kelvin .
The script will create a graph showing the radiation curves for each temperature.
