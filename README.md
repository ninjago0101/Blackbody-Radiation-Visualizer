# Blackbody-Radiation-Visualizer
This project is a Python tool that helps visualize blackbody radiation using Planck’s law. It allows  to plot the intensity of radiation for different temperatures and explore key trends like the peak wavelength (using Wien’s displacement law) and the total power emitted (using the Stefan-Boltzmann law). 



Features

Asks  for the number of temperatures and their values in Kelvin.
Automatically computes trends like Wien’s peak wavelength and total emitted power for each temperature.
Each curve is labeled 

How to run:

1. Requirements:
Install Python 3.x.
Install Matplotlib by running:
"pip install matplotlib"
2. Running  
save .py file and run via python 

3.Promtps
Enter the number of temperatures you want to plot.
Input each temperature in Kelvin .
The script will create a graph showing the radiation curves for each temperature.
